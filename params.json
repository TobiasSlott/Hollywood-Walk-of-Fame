  "body": "### What is this page all about?\r\nThis is a small website designed to describe the Network of Hollywood celebrities. I have walked on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and acted like a true tourist, lying down on the street and taking pictures with the stars. But are some stars more prestiges than others? Who are the most famous stars? Who is the STAR of stars? This website describes a project the examines the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/WalkOfFamelogo.png\" width=\"500\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nIn the project a Network of Hollywood stars will be created and by looking at this more closely some curious things can be said about the celebrities. \r\n\r\n### Hollywood Walk of Fame\r\n[The Hollywood Walk of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame) comprises more than 2,500 five-pointed terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in Hollywood, California. The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the entertainment industry, bearing the names of...  \r\nYou get it. It's a bunch of stars on the sidewalk. This project focuses on how the stars can be connected through Wikipedia and if we can detect anything in the stars. \r\n\r\n#### Categories and Awards\r\nEvery star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is categorised. This information is useful for the project, since now there are groups of stars to look for. Let's find out of the connections between stars reveals that the they can truly be divided into communities actors, recording artists and so on. There are 5 categories and they are as follows:\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/film_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Motion pictures\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/television_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Broadcast television\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/recording_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Audio recording\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/radio_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Broadcast radio\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/liveperformance_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Theatre/Live performance\r\n\r\n### Project Assignment A\r\nThis [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wmsh_R2Vp8) is the first part of the project. It gives a short summary of the project and acts as part A.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img1.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img2.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img3.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img4.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### The Network\r\nAlright let's explain this \"Network\" that has been mentioned a couple of times. In the project the network is a mapping of how stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are linked to each other. The stars are the network's nodes, and these nodes are connected through edges/links.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/simple_graph.png\" width=\"300\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe list of all stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame can be downloaded from Wikipedia and we can also see what category the stars are in. Now that we have the network's nodes we want to connect them. This is done by looking at the individual Wikipedia pages of the stars and see what other stars they link to. If there is a link from one star to another on the Hollywood Walk of Fame there will be an edge between the nodes. The edges will be directed, meaning they are pointing one way. For example one of the first links on the wikipage of our good friend [Samuel L. Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson) is [Quentin Tarantino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino) (take a look yourself), because they have collaborated many times in motion pictures. In fact there is also a link from Tarantino's wikipage to Sam Jackson, so in the network there is an edge from Jackson to Tarantino and another edge from Tarantino to Jackson.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/quentin_star.png\" width=\"240\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/sam_quentin_star.png\" width=\"240\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/sam_star.png\" width=\"180\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe network contains 2296 nodes connected by 25130 so it's exactly what you would call small... The many edges means that some stars are mentioned a lot in wikipages probably because they are big an influential stars. Every node in the network will be a name of a Hollywood celebrity, have the Hollywood star category, and it will also have number as a node attribute. The Hollywood stars have a knack for gaining recognition and fame because of the many award shows they host. The most talented receive awards, this will help tell us who is the STAR of the stars. The node attributes therefore is the number of awards the star has received. An edge can represent many things in this network, friendship, marriage, collaboration, etc., and there are many edges. The most famous and influential star must have appear in many wikipages and so will have many edges in the network.\r\n\r\n### Properties of the Network\r\nA network has certain characteristics like average degree, degree distribution and connectedness. Further network analysis like detecting and examining communities or centrality measures will be included in the project. For now let's take a look at the basic network properties for the Hollywood star network.  \r\n  \r\nThe degree of a node means how many connections it has to other nodes. This tells us something about how connected the network is. It can also give us an idea of what to expect for how many connections famous stars, the average stars and the least famous stars should have. The average degree of the network is 18.605, which means the average star has 18-19 connections to other stars on their wikipages. Our STAR of the stars should there have higher degree than this.  \r\n  \r\nConsidering that nodes on average have edges to 18 other nodes means that the network is strongly connected. We are dealing with a giant component where many stars are connected and a fraction is not included. It is possible to move from one node to another in the strongly connected big component using only few steps. This property resembles [Six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/Hollywood_Graph.png\" width=\"690\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nMost of the stars are then to each other, but what causes the high average degree. Are some stars simply connected to all or is number of connections evenly spread out. The degree distribution will clarify this.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/deg_dist.png\" width=\"1000\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nClearly we can observe that many nodes have in- and out-degrees below the average, and yet there are also nodes with degrees much higher than the average. This does not contradict presence of a giant component, but rather encourages the idea of our STAR of stars. There obviously is stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that appear on many other Wikipedia pages and have many links to stars on their own wikipages. \r\n\r\n### Centrality measures\r\nThe STAR of stars will be a central part of the network. But what exactly does that mean? This page has mentioned a couple of times that the most famous and influential stars are the ones with the highest number of links. This is just one measure of centrality in a network called Degree centrality. 4 different centrality measures are examined in the project's network analysis. This can give us a great clue to which stars we should take our picture with! Now let's find the top 10 stars for each centrality measure.  \r\n  \r\nThe first measure is the Degree centrality. Since the network is directed There are two top 10s for this measure, one for stars with most ingoing edges and one for stars most outgoing edges.\r\n\r\nTop 10 Hollywood Stars by in-degree:\r\n\r\n1. Frank Sinatra: 209\r\n2. Elvis Presley: 156\r\n3. Associated Press: 146\r\n4. Bing Crosby: 143\r\n5. John Wayne: 142\r\n6. Ronald Reagan: 135\r\n7. Bob Hope: 124\r\n8. Bette Davis: 123\r\n9. The Simpsons: 121\r\n10. Katharine Hepburn: 113\r\n\r\nTop 10 Hollywood Stars by out-degree:\r\n\r\n1. Frank Sinatra: 301\r\n2. John Ford: 195\r\n3. Cary Grant: 193\r\n4. Bette Davis: 191\r\n5. Bing Crosby: 189\r\n6. Elvis Presley: 189\r\n7. Gary Cooper: 189\r\n8. James Stewart: 180\r\n9. John Wayne: 178\r\n10. Clark Gable: 177\r\n\r\nThe measure of centrality is Betweenness centrality. Betweenness centrality is a measure of how much does a node appear in shortest paths of the graph. For the Hollywood star network this means that stars with high betweenness centrality have a central role for most other stars as they connect many them together. Low betweenness centrality means that your Wikipedia page does not have to be visited as much to navigate the network.\r\n\r\nTop 10 stars by betweenness centrality:\r\n\r\n1. Frank Sinatra: 0.0468845426201\r\n2. Bing Crosby: 0.0197847309576\r\n3. Elvis Presley: 0.0186038740812\r\n4. John Ford: 0.01854986309\r\n5. Cary Grant: 0.0179541950359\r\n6. Bette Davis: 0.0154747766626\r\n7. Barbra Streisand: 0.0146693888956\r\n8. Gary Cooper: 0.01464187824\r\n9. Clark Gable: 0.0146325770905\r\n10. Dean Martin: 0.0144237619484\r\n\r\nNext up is Eigenvector centrality. This is not a simple measure of how many in- and out-going edges a node has, but rather how connected it is to other nodes that are connected to each other. So if many nodes are all connected to each other the eigenvector centrality will be high for them, while if a nodes is connected to other nodes that are not connected then the eigenvector centrality will low. Stars out in the cold be themselves will be at the bottom of this list. Eigenvector centrality can be calculated for ingoing- and outgoing edges so we get two top 10s.\r\n\r\nTop 10 stars by eigenvector centrality for in-degree:\r\n\r\n1. Frank Sinatra: 0.176210790305\r\n2. Clark Gable: 0.151450535772\r\n3. Katharine Hepburn: 0.150112705248\r\n4. Cary Grant: 0.148403951492\r\n5. James Stewart: 0.144565609714\r\n6. Bette Davis: 0.14118247057\r\n7. Ronald Reagan: 0.137370315083\r\n8. Humphrey Bogart: 0.132940054506\r\n9. Gary Cooper: 0.127672013335\r\n10. Joan Crawford: 0.11866559248\r\n\r\nTop 10 stars by eigenvector centrality for out-degree:\r\n\r\n1. George Cukor: 0.178118739679\r\n2. John Ford: 0.144537412388\r\n3. George Raft: 0.140237847483\r\n4. James Stewart: 0.138821082299\r\n5. Gary Cooper: 0.128352026294\r\n6. Humphrey Bogart: 0.125581100395\r\n7. Cary Grant: 0.12156496433\r\n8. Howard Hawks: 0.1203120006\r\n9. Michael Curtiz: 0.119999232333\r\n10. Clark Gable: 0.11813353565\r\n\r\nDo we start to see any recurring names? Let's look at the fourth centrality measure to be sure. It is Closeness centrality which is calculated as the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph.\r\n\r\nTop 10 stars by closeness centrality:\r\n\r\n1. Frank Sinatra: 0.311262336552\r\n2. George Cukor: 0.309512618539\r\n3. Cary Grant: 0.309202236851\r\n4. James Stewart: 0.309016306462\r\n5. George Raft: 0.307046873719\r\n6. Michael Curtiz: 0.306924617348\r\n7. John Ford: 0.306436563892\r\n8. Howard Hawks: 0.304379536612\r\n9. Gary Cooper: 0.300757384499\r\n10. Mae West: 0.299297680633\r\n\r\nEspecially one name stand out as the most central topping all but one list. [Frank Sinatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra) ladies and gentlemen is the most central node in the Hollywood Walk of Fame network. Let's hope he is also one the stars with award wins and nominations.\r\n\r\nTop 10 stars by award count:\r\n\r\n1. Barbra Streisand: 24\r\n2. Angela Lansbury: 23\r\n3. Frank Sinatra: 22\r\n4. Meryl Streep: 22\r\n5. Katharine Hepburn: 19\r\n6. Glenn Close: 18\r\n7. John Lithgow: 18\r\n8. Kelsey Grammer: 17\r\n9. The Beatles: 17\r\n10. Mary Tyler Moore: 16\r\n\r\nMr. Sinatra is indeed at the top of list as well. Definitely get a picture of his star on the Walk of Fame, the STAR of stars has been found.  \r\nPS Didn't we all expect Meryl Streep to be a mile ahead on the award list?\r\n\r\n### Community detection\r\nNow it's time to look at the stars and see if they group up in nice ways, kind of like looking at stars in the sky and finding the Big Dipper. In the project the best partition of the network is found with an algorithm designed for exactly this, but it might also be fascinating to know if the network can be divided into groups that we have proposed. We might be able to answer about the Hollywood Walk of Fame network such as... Can we see communities based on the categorisation (actors with actors, singers with singers, etc.)? Is their a group of stars with awards and a group of the more unfortunate stars without? We can look at the modularity to see if communities makes sense. Modularity measure the strength of division of a network into groups.\r\n\r\nFirst up is the best partition which can be found using the Python Louvain algorithm. The groups of stars we get from this is the so-called best partition. It appears the we have some lonely celebrities because the best partition 108 groups and 97 of these are groups of 1. A couple of the groups contain a more reasonable number of stars, 404, 401, 612, 368, 269, 22, 55 and 62. Later we can use text analysis to see what kind of stars are in the different groups. For now let's just mention that the best partition has a modularity of 0.786. We can show the network where the colour of each node indicates what group it is part of.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/Hollywood_Graph_partition.png\" width=\"690\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThere definitely groups with more nodes in them, and these groups also seem to part of the giant component.\r\n\r\nIn order to look for a Categorisation community the categories for each star is needed. Luckily these are included in the Wikipedia list of Hollywood Walk of Fame stars. This is how the stars get partitioned.\r\n* Motion picture: 1125\r\n* Broadcast television: 483\r\n* Audio recording: 420\r\n* Broadcast radio: 188\r\n* Theatre/Live performance: 44\r\nThis partition has a modularity of 0.570. So even though the stars actually have categories, they can be partitioned better as seen above and thereby get a higher modularity.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to divide the network into a group of award winning stars and the rest, we can simply look at the node attributes. This is how the stars get partitioned.\r\n* Awards: 1673\r\n* No awards: 623\r\nThis partition has a modularity of 0.495. Admitted, it gives more sense to test the category partition, but not much needed to be added to test this partition since we already have the node attributes.\r\n\r\n### Text analysis\r\n\r\nLots of the stuff on this page has been about the network of Hollywood stars. Let's in this section focus celebrities and see if any common information can be found. We can take a look at the text in the Wikipedia pages and use some text analysis to retrieve words that are Hollywood specific. To do this a couple steps are completed. First you download the text of the Wikipedia page, then separate all words in the text and count them. This is where we find the term frequency (TF) of words. Next step is to count \"normal\" a word is in the text. We want to find important words that are related to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and not just end up with words like \"the\" and \"of\". If a word appears in many of the texts we consider it very normal and therefore uninteresting, This is where we find inverse document frequency (IDF) of words. Final step is to combine TF and IDF, now we have assigned values to each word in all Wikipedia pages. The TF-IDF values varies depending on how wikipages we are looking at, so it can be applied to the community detection. But let's take a look at the most Hollywood related words overall.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_all.png\" width=\"1000\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThese words clearly relates to subject of Hollywood stars, as they relates to the entertainment industry \"record\", \"picture\", \"performance\", \"studio\" \"artist\", which is exactly what these coral pink stars is given for. \"brother\" is weirdly enough related to Hollywood, so too bad for you guys with sisters out there, the fame is in the brotherhood. Something as nice as \"friend\" is apparently relevant here, so as long as you have friend you are star-material, everybody wins.\r\n\r\n#### Best partition\r\nNow let's look at keywords for communities found in the best partition. Using the same TF-IDF approach we can look at most highly valued words in each group.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_1.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_2.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_3.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_4.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_5.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_8.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_9.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_10.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWord clouds for community 1 and community 2 clearly shows that they are communities of actors and singers. The first cloud shows words like \"film\", \"role\", \"show\", episode while the second cloud has words like \"grammy\", \"concert\", \"song\" and \"vocal\". There words you could link to the entertainment industry in the first 5 clouds. it should noted that final three communities contain very few stars, so for example sixth cloud contain a clear word \"western\". It's because the classical western stars Gene Autry, William Boyd and Roy Rogers are in this community, from here on out known as the western community.\r\n\r\n#### Category communities\r\nThe groups of stars based on their category is not as strong a partition as the Best partition, no shit... well also because it has a lower modularity. But can we see keywords specific to categories, will we see words like \"actor\" for Motion picture stars and so on.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_category_1.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_category_3.png\" width=\"350\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nNote there are only included two word clouds out of the 5 categories. The simply made sense. It is quite easy to detect which cloud is build from the Audio recording category. Apparently it is a lot easier to detect musicians and other recording artist based on the words in a text alone. The other word cloud actually represents the Motion picture category which is not clear at all. It is in fact not easy to conclude anything from this word cloud at all, and it was the story for the other categories. I don't why we can see words like \"shooting\" and \"depression\" as minor keywords, we'll let that one hang out there. It seems that the Python Louvain algorithm did a better job dividing Motion picture stars into the right group than the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce who decides which celebrities should receive stars and what category they belong to. But who are we to judge, clearly not all word clouds make sense but they look cool!\r\n\r\n#### Fictional characters\r\nThere a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_characters_with_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame) on Wikipedia containing all fictional characters on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It might be fun to see if we can detect some Hollywood related words in the wikipages for these stars, or are we just going to see \"cartoon\" and \"animated\".\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_fict_1.png\" width=\"550\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nAlright so the fictional characters clearly also relates to Hollywood entertainment industry. \"film\", \"movie\", \"star\", \"show\", \"award\", words they all can be observed in the other word clouds. You can also find \"cartoon\" in there, so the suspicion was not totally off. The fictional characters are certainly characters that fit in the Hollywood Walk of Fame network.\r\n\r\n### Data from Wikipedia\r\nThere are plenty of information on Hollywood celebrities on Wikipedia. Since the basis for the project is the [list of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_characters_with_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame) found on Wikipedia it makes sense to also download their individual wikipages while we are at it. We are also looking at awards in order to create node attributes and to use for community detection. The dataset consists of the list stars, their individual Wikipedia pages and lists of winners and nominees of one selected award for each category.  \r\nThe considered awards are:\r\n* Academy awards (Film): [best actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor), [best actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress), [best supporting actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor), [best supporting actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress)\r\n* Primetime Emmy Awards (Television): [lead actor comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actor_in_a_Comedy_Series), [lead actress comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actress_in_a_Comedy_Series), [lead actor drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actor_in_a_Drama_Series), [lead actress drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actress_in_a_Drama_Series)\r\n* Radio Academy's Hall of Fame (Radio): [Members and Fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Academy#Hall_of_Fame)\r\n* Tony Awards (Live performance): [leading actor play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Play), [leading actress play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Play), [leading actor musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Musical), [leading actress musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Musical)\r\n* Grammy Awards (Recording): [Album of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year), [Record of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year), [Song of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Song_of_the_Year), [Best New Artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_New_Artist)\r\n\r\n### Detailed analysisDownload the data\r\nIf you want to have closer look at the project you can download the data and check out the Explainer notebook. The actual analysis in this project is done in an iPython notebook. The Hollywood star network is constructed from the Wikipedia pages, download this data [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3w8myvb9c3s7wuf/Hollywood_Stars.zip?dl=0).
