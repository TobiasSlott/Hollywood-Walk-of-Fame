  "body": "### What is this page all about?\r\nThis is a small website designed to describe the Network of Hollywood celebreties. I have walked on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and acted like a true tourist, lying down on the street and taking pictures with the stars. But are some stars more prestiges than others? Who are the most famous stars? Who is the STAR of stars? This website describes a project the examines the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/WalkOfFamelogo.png\" width=\"500\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nIn the project a Network of Hollywood stars will be created and by looking at this more closely some curious things can be said about the celebreties. \r\n\r\n### Hollywood Walk of Fame\r\n[The Hollywood Walk of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame) comprises more than 2,500 five-pointed terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in Hollywood, California. The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the entertainment industry, bearing the names of...  \r\nYou get it. It's a bunch of stars on the sidewalk. This project focuses on how the stars can be connected through Wikipedia and if we can detect anything in the stars. \r\n\r\n#### Categories and Awards\r\nEvery star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is categorised. This information is useful for the project, since now there are groups of stars to look for. Let's find out of the connections between stars reveals that the they can truly be divided into communities actors, recording artists and so on. There are 5 categories and they are as follows:\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/film_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Motion pictures\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/television_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Broadcast television\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/recording_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Audio recording\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/radio_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Broadcast radio\r\n* <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/liveperformance_symbol.png\" width=\"25\"> Theatre/Live performance\r\n\r\n### Project Assignment A\r\nThis [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wmsh_R2Vp8) is the first part of the project. It gives a short summary of the project and acts as part A.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img1.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img2.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img3.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img4.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### The Network\r\nAlright let's explain this \"Network\" that has been mentioned a couple of times. In the project the network is a mapping of how stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are linked to each other. The stars are the network's nodes, and these nodes are connected through edges/links.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/simple_graph.png\" width=\"300\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe list of all stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame can be downloaded from Wikipedia. Now that we have the network's nodes we want to connect them. This is done by looking at the individual Wikipedia pages of the stars and see what other stars they link to. If there is a link from one star to another on the Hollywood Walk of Fame there will be an edge between the nodes. The edges will be directed, meaning they are pointing one way. For example one of the first links on the wikipage of our good friend [Samuel L. Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson) is [Quentin Tarantino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino) (take a look yourself), because they have collaborated many times in motion pictures. In fact there is also a link from Tarantino's wikipage to Sam Jackson, so in the network there is an edge from Jackson to Tarantino and another edge from Tarantino to Jackson.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/quentin_star.png\" width=\"240\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/sam_quentin_star.png\" width=\"240\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/sam_star.png\" width=\"180\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* Nodes and edges and attributes\r\n\r\nAn edge can represent many things in this network friendship, marriage, collaboration, etc., and there are many edges. The most most famous and influential star must have appear in many wikipages and so will have many edges in the network.\r\nOn wikipedia you can reach any page within 5 steps... (?)\r\n\r\n* Network theory, degree, centrality, community\r\n* Graph statistics\r\n* Graph plots\r\n* Degree distribution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Project overview\r\nHere is an overview of the ideas for the project.\r\n* Who is the most connected and central star in the Network?\r\n* Can we see groups of celebreties? Are there communities?\r\n* dig\r\n\r\n### Centrality measures\r\n\r\n\r\n### Community detection and analysis\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_all.png\" width=\"1000\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n#### Create proposed communities\r\n\r\n### Plain text analysis\r\n\r\n#### Similarity ideas\r\n\r\n#### Category communities\r\n\r\n#### Award communities\r\n\r\n#### Fictional characters community\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data from Wikipedia\r\nThere are plenty of information on Hollywood celebrities on Wikipedia. Since the basis for the project is the [list of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_characters_with_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame) found on Wikipedia it makes sense to also download their individual wikipages while we are at it.\r\n\r\nWe are also looking at awards ....\r\nThe considered awards are:\r\n* Academy awards (Film): [best actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor), [best actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress), [best supporting actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor), [best supporting actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress)\r\n* Primetime Emmy Awards (Television): [lead actor comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actor_in_a_Comedy_Series), [lead actress comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actress_in_a_Comedy_Series), [lead actor drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actor_in_a_Drama_Series), [lead actress drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actress_in_a_Drama_Series)\r\n* Radio Academy's Hall of Fame (Radio): [Members and Fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Academy#Hall_of_Fame)\r\n* Tony Awards (Live performance): [leading actor play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Play), [leading actress play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Play), [leading actor musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Musical), [leading actress musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Musical)\r\n* Grammy Awards (Recording): [Album of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year), [Record of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year), [Song of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Song_of_the_Year), [Best New Artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_New_Artist)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detailed analysis\r\nThe actual analysis in this project is done in an iPython notebook which can be seen here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
