  "body": "### What is this page all about?\r\nThis is a small website designed to describe the Network of Hollywood celebreties. I have walked on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and acted like a true tourist, lying down on the street and taking pictures with the stars. But are some stars more prestiges than others? Who are the most famous stars? Who is the STAR of stars? This website describes a project the examines the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/WalkOfFamelogo.png\" width=\"500\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nIn the project a Network of Hollywood stars will be created and by looking at this more closely some curious things can be said about the celebreties. \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n* hej\r\n* med\r\n* dig\r\n\r\n### Project Assignment A\r\nThis [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wmsh_R2Vp8) is the first part of the project. It gives a short summary of the project and acts as part A.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img1.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img2.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img3.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/video_img4.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Data from Wikipedia\r\nThere are plenty of information on Hollywood celebrities on Wikipedia. Since the basis for the project is [list of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_characters_with_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame) found on Wikipedia it makes sense to also download their individual wikipages while we are at it.\r\n\r\nWe are also looking at awards ....\r\nThe considered awards are:\r\n* Academy awards (Film): [best actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor), [best actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress), [best supporting actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor), [best supporting actress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress)\r\n* Primetime Emmy Awards (Television): [lead actor comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actor_in_a_Comedy_Series), [lead actress comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actress_in_a_Comedy_Series), [lead actor drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actor_in_a_Drama_Series), [lead actress drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actress_in_a_Drama_Series)\r\n* Radio Academy's Hall of Fame (Radio): [Members and Fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Academy#Hall_of_Fame)\r\n* Tony Awards (Live performance): [leading actor play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Play), [leading actress play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Play), [leading actor musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Musical), [leading actress musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Musical)\r\n* Grammy Awards (Recording): [Album of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year), [Record of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year), [Song of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Song_of_the_Year), [Best New Artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_New_Artist)\r\n\r\n### Communities\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/word_cloud_all.png\" width=\"1000\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
