I have walked on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and acted like a true tourist, lying down on the street and taking pictures with the stars. But are some stars more prestiges than others? Who are the most famous stars? Who is the STAR of stars? This website describes a project the examines the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/WalkOfFamelogo.png\" width=\"500\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nIn the project a Network of Hollywood stars will be created and by looking at this more closely some curious things can be said about the celebreties. \r\n\r\n### Hollywood Walk of Fame\r\n\r\n\r\n### Categories and Awards\r\n\r\n\r\n### Project overview\r\nHere is an overview of the ideas for the project.\r\n* Who is the most connected and central star in the Network?\r\n* Can we see groups of celebreties?
