<p>This is a small website designed to describe the Network of Hollywood celebreties. I have walked on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and acted like a true tourist, lying down on the street and taking pictures with the stars. But are some stars more prestiges than others? Who are the most famous stars? Who is the STAR of stars? This website describes a project the examines the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>

</p>

<p>In the project a Network of Hollywood stars will be created and by looking at this more closely some curious things can be said about the celebreties. </p>

<p>Here is an overview of the ideas for the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is the most connected and central star in the Network?</li>
<li>Can we see groups of celebreties? Are there communities?</li>

<a id="hollywood-walk-of-fame" class="anchor" href="#hollywood-walk-of-fame" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hollywood Walk of Fame</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame">The Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> comprises more than 2,500 five-pointed terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in Hollywood, California. The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the entertainment industry, bearing the names of...<br>
You get it. It's a bunch of stars on the sidewalk. This project focuses on how the stars can be connected through Wikipedia and if we can detect anything in the stars. </p>

<p>Every star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is categorised. This information is useful for the project, since now there are groups of stars to look for. Let's find out of the connections between stars reveals that the they can truly be divided into communities actors, recording artists and so on. There are 5 categories and they are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>

<a id="the-network" class="anchor" href="#the-network" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Network</h3>

<p>Alright let's explain this "Network" that has been mentioned a couple of times. In the project the network is a mapping of how stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are linked to each other. The stars are the network's nodes, and these nodes are connected through edges/links.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/simple_graph.png" width="300">
</p>

<p>The list of all stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame can be downloaded from Wikipedia and we can also see what category the stars are in. Now that we have the network's nodes we want to connect them. This is done by looking at the individual Wikipedia pages of the stars and see what other stars they link to. If there is a link from one star to another on the Hollywood Walk of Fame there will be an edge between the nodes. The edges will be directed, meaning they are pointing one way. For example one of the first links on the wikipage of our good friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> (take a look yourself), because they have collaborated many times in motion pictures. In fact there is also a link from Tarantino's wikipage to Sam Jackson, so in the network there is an edge from Jackson to Tarantino and another edge from Tarantino to Jackson.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/quentin_star.png" width="240">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/sam_quentin_star.png" width="240">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TobiasSlott/SocialGraphs/master/sam_star.png" width="180">
</p>

<p>The network contains 2296 nodes connected by 25130 so it's exactly what you would call small... The many edges means that some stars are mentioned a lot in wikipages probably because they are big an influential stars. Every node in the network will be a name of a Hollywood celebrity, have the Hollywood star category, and it will also have number as a node attribute. The Hollywood stars have a knack for gaining recognition and fame because of the many award shows they host. The most talented receive awards, this will help tell us who is the STAR of the stars. The node attributes therefore is the number of awards the star has received. An edge can represent many things in this network, friendship, marriage, collaboration, etc., and there are many edges. The most famous and influential star must have appear in many wikipages and so will have many edges in the network.</p>

<h3>
<a id="properties-of-the-network" class="anchor" href="#properties-of-the-network" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Properties of the Network</h3>

<p>A network has certain characteristics like average degree, degree distribution and connectedness. Further network analysis like detecting and examining communities or centrality measures will be included in the project. For now let's take a look at the basic network properties for the Hollywood star network.  </p>

<p>The degree of a node means how many connections it has to other nodes. This tells us something about how connected the network is. It can also give us an idea of what to expect for how many connections famous stars, the average stars and the least famous stars should have. The average degree of the network is 18.605, which means the average star has 18-19 connections to other stars on their wikipages. Our STAR of the stars should there have higher degree than this.  </p>

<p>Considering that nodes on average have edges to 18 other nodes means that the network is strongly connected. We are dealing with a giant component where many stars are connected and a fraction is not included. It is possible to move from one node to another in the strongly connected big component using only few steps. This property resembles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">Six degrees of separation</a>.</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>Most of the stars are then to each other, but what causes the high average degree. Are some stars simply connected to all or is number of connections evenly spread out. The degree distribution will clarify this.</p>

<a id="data-from-wikipedia" class="anchor" href="#data-from-wikipedia" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data from Wikipedia</h3>

<p>There are plenty of information on Hollywood celebrities on Wikipedia. Since the basis for the project is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_characters_with_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame">list of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> found on Wikipedia it makes sense to also download their individual wikipages while we are at it.</p>

<p>We are also looking at awards ....
The considered awards are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Academy awards (Film): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor">best actor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress">best actress</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor">best supporting actor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress">best supporting actress</a>
